# Tabs (Motion)

Tabs are a navigational element that allows users to easily move between groups of related content. The main difference between this component and the older

## Motion?

There are two main differences between the `tabs-motion` module and the original `tabs` module:

1. `tabs-motion` has an updated design using an animated Tab highlight.
2. `tabs-motion` is implemented in accordance with the [WAI-ARIA 1.1 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel).

The newer design will be considered our default Tabs component going forward but the older design will remain until our next major version (which is currently slated for late 2021).

## Accessibility

This component implements the latest [WAI-ARIA Tabs specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel). Here are the key takeaways from the spec:

- Proper `role` and `aria` attributes are assigned based on the currently active Tab and TabList orientation.
- Directional keys are used to move focus through Tabs.
- When a Tab is focused, the associated TabPanel is automatically opened unless `keyboardActivation` is set to `manual`.
- When focusing a Tab, the next focusable target is the associated TabPanel's content.
