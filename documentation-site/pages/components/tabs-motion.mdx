# Tabs (Motion)

Tabs are a navigational element that allows users to easily move between groups of related content. The main difference between this component and the older

## Motion?

There are two main differences between the `tabs-motion` module and the original `tabs` module:

1. `tabs-motion` has an updated design using an animated Tab highlight.
2. `tabs-motion` is implemented in accordance with the [WAI-ARIA 1.1 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel).

The newer design will be considered our default Tabs component going forward but the older design will remain until our next major version (which is currently slated for late 2021).

## Accessibility

This component implements the latest [WAI-ARIA Tabs specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel). Here are the key takeaways from the spec:

- Proper `role` and `aria` attributes are assigned based on the currently active Tab and TabList orientation.
- Directional keys are used to move focus through Tabs.
- When a Tab is focused, the associated TabPanel is automatically opened unless `keyboardActivation` is set to `manual`.
- When focusing a Tab, the next focusable target is the associated TabPanel's content.

## Examples

<Example title="Basics" path="tabs-motion/basic.js">
  <BasicExample />
</Example>

A basic, uncontrolled `Tabs` component. Try focusing a Tab and using the directional keys to move focus to other Tabs. Focus will "wrap" once you've reached the start or end of the TabList. To shift focus to the Tab's content, just hit `Tab` at any time.

<Example title="Keys" path="tabs-motion/keys.js">
  <KeysExample />
</Example>

We use the index of each Tab to provide default keys. You can however, pass in your own keys to each Tab. React keys can be either a string or a number so `1` and `"1"` are both valid. The component will default to numbers if no keys are provided.

<Example title="Keyboard activation" path="tabs-motion/keyboard-activation.js">
  <KeyboardActivationExample />
</Example>

By default, when a Tab receives focus it will activate the Tab and show the corresponding TabPanel. You can change this by setting `keyboardActivation` to `manual`. In the example above, focus a Tab and then use the directional keys to move focus to other Tabs. To activate the Tab you need to press `Enter` or the space bar.

<Example
  title="Vertical orientation"
  path="tabs-motion/vertical-orientation.js"
>
  <VerticalOrientationExample />
</Example>

Tabs can be displayed in either a `horizontal` (the default) or `vertical` orientation. The `aria-orientation` attribute will be assigned accordingly. Note, when in the `vertical` orientation, the `Up` and `Down` keys are used to move focus between Tabs. While a Tab is focused, the page's default vertical page scroll is disabled.

<Example title="Fixed fill" path="tabs-motion/fixed.js">
  <FixedExample />
</Example>

The `fill` prop allows you to control how Tabs "fill" the available space.

By default, `fill` is set to `intrinsic`, which means Tabs will take up as much space as their `title` content requires, with overflowing Tabs reachable via scrolling or moving focus with the direction keys.

In the example above, we set `fill` to `fixed`, which divides the space in the TabList equally between each Tab. With this setting you need to be sure the content of the Tab is short enough to fit.

<Example title="Disabled" path="tabs-motion/disabled.js">
  <DisabledExample />
</Example>

You can disable all of the Tabs (except for the active one) by passing `disabled` to the top-level `Tabs` component. Note, you can also pass `disabled` to individual `Tab` components, which will override the top-level prop.

<Example title="Leading icon" path="tabs-motion/artwork.js">
  <ArtworkExample />
</Example>

You can use a leading icon for each Tab with the `artwork` prop. Icons from `baseui/icon` will work out-of-the-box, as you can see in the example above. If you want to use a custom icon or component, your component will be rendered with a small margin between it and the Tab title. Your component will receive a `size` and `color` prop too if you want to use them.
